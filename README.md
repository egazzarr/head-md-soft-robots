# PHOTONIC FATALITY

## Soft Robotics workshop - MA Media Design, HEAD, Genève

    Partners: CNRS, CEA, INRIA
    Professors: Clara Rigaud, Benjamin Gaulon

As our planet faces accelerating ecological crises, robotics offers new ways of perceiving, sensing, and interacting with the environment. Moving beyond efficiency and automation, this workshop explores soft, ecological, and sensitive robots.

## A speculation on robotic short-sightedness

Are environmental robots useful?

What do they feed on?

These questions form the starting point for the development of a digital plant trapped in an infinite recursive cycle of growth and death.

The soft robot’s upward movement is powered by a solar panel placed on the ground. As the plant-robot grows and gradually assembles itself, it spreads over the panel, blocking the light that sustains its only source of nourishment. In its attempt to survive, the robot inevitably causes its own death. Survival contains the seed of extinction and the plant's fatality is eternal resurrection. 

The work draws inspiration from robotic short-sightedness: machines designed to optimise and solve a single task, unable to reflect beyond their narrowly programmed objective. 

The project positions itself as a playful yet critical contribution to the vast and fascinating universe of useless robots. It is influenced by the Japanese concept of Chindōgu (珍道具), the practice of inventing ingenious everyday gadgets that seem to be ideal solutions to particular problems, yet ultimately undermine their own usefulness by generating new contradictions.

As technological evolution increasingly permeates every aspect of life and labour, this work invites a pause. It asks the viewer to breathe, and question the assumed necessity and value of technological artefacts. In doing so, it offers a contradiction as a space for reflection.
